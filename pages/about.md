## Intro about me

I'm probably best known as "[pydanny](https://www.google.com/search?q=pydanny)", one of the authors of Two Scoops of Django.

I love to hang out with my [wife](https://audrey.feldroy.com/), play with my [daughter](/tags/uma), do [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://academyofbrazilianjiujitsu.com/), write [books](/books), and read books.
