title: Uncovering An Pricing Outlier
description: I found an interesting outlier that I wanted to share with everyone!

##### A price outlier
On my Singapore public housing resale market past transaction search tool, I had 
a scatter plot that compares home prices with prices per area ( square feet / 
metres ). The plot shows a general positive and linear correlation between home
prices and price per area. Homes with a higher price per square area should fetch
higher overall prices. However, one interesting data point stuck out on the left
top corner of the scatter plot.

With a resale transaction price of around 1.5 million SGD, this public house’s
price per square foot is much lower than the overall market trend. Looking into
the other attributes of that home sale, I realised the property is really large,
standing at almost 4,000 square feet. For context, to my knowledge, most 
recently launched family-sized public flats in Singapore are only around 1,000
square feet. At its point of sale, the home also only has around 47 years of 
lease left, which is considered on the lower end as Singapore public homes are
sold with a 99-year lease. On expiring of its lease, the property should by
right be returned to the Singapore government, and the value of the home should
be zero.

##### Similar price points
Comparing this transaction to other similarly priced transactions ( SGD 1.5 
million ) on the right side of the same scatter plot, crudely suggests that the
rough 40 years of lease is equivalent to 3,000 square feet of extra space. This
statement is of course not representative, as it is made from three 
million-dollar transactions. But I still felt it was an interesting thought
experiment to think about the trade-offs households are making when making 
certain home purchases. I guess this is my economics training in me screaming
from within me.

##### Concluding thoughts
Interestingly, this property’s sale has already been covered by some of our Singapore media outlets a while ago, even though I have been too numb from these million-dollar public home narratives to read these million-dollar articles anymore. This was why I decided to spend more time doing my own analytics digging on the data that is available to us all. And while I missed out these articles previously, I realise this rather unique public home sale did make me a bit more intrigued about this home sale, and got me to learn about a part of Singapore that I never realised existed ! 

This is a good example of how data visualisations can show interesting patterns within our data that we may never realise !
