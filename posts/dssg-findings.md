title: Sharing on 11th July, 2024 at DataScience SG ( DSSG )
description: I did a sharing on my analysis of Singapore public housing resale market 
---

Hi all! Thanks to those who came to my analytics sharing on the Singapore
public housing resale market on 11th July, 2024. For those who couldn’t make
it, attached is the “dashboard” that updates daily from data from data.gov.sg. 
Those interested can see the trend charts [here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/sg-public-home-trends).

For now, while I created 4 charts showing different aspects of our Singapore
public housing resale market, this is the insight that intrigues me the most -
**As recent as Jan 2020, about 70% of our Singapore public housing resale flats
were sold at less than half a million SGD. As of June 2024, the numbers have
totally flipped, and about 70% of our Singapore public housing resale flats
sold at half a million SGD or more. I am definitely curious how our overall
Singapore public housing resale flat prices will be like in the near future.**

In addition, the rising percentage of million dollar public resale homes is a
bit worrying too, rising from less than 1% in Jan 2020, to easily around 2-4%
during H1 2024. That said, this percentage of million dollar public resale
homes is still a small percentage of overall public resale homes sold in
Singapore. I am personally curious how this percentage will trend in the coming
months and years.

At the end of the day, I want more varied angles to our Singapore public
housing resale market that I don’t see from mainstream media outlets. And
since I have built this for myself, I am thinking it costs me little to
release it to the general Singapore public as well. So friends, feel free
to come back to this “dashboard” to review these numbers with me, or share
with anyone interested to understand these different views to our Singapore
public resale housing market. I promise to share more updates or newer analyses
in the near future!
