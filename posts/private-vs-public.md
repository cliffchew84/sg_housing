Singapore’s public housing is internationally renowned for providing affordable
housing to its citizens. Complementing its top-down urban planning approach,
many academicians attribute Singapore’s effective public housing policies as a
key driver to the city-state’s meteoric rise to first-world status since the
1980s.

However, this narrative has started to change among Singaporeans since the
start of the pandemic in late 2019. As of September 2022, public housing prices
in Singapore have increased for 27 straight months while seeing record number
of million-dollar public housing transactions. And on 29th September 2022, the
Singapore government announced a new set of cooling measures targeted to keep
public housing prices affordable. So, is Singapore’s public housing prices 
spiralling out of control?

Housing has always been a very dear topic to me. I did a minor in Urban Studies
at NUS, and wrote my Master’s thesis investigating the impact of the NEL subway
line in Singapore on neighbouring public housing prices. In this post, I will 
use publicly available public housing resale data to explore the price trends
in our Singapore public housing market.
