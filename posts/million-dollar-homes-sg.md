title: Are Singapore public homes still cheap?
description: I crunched the data to find out!  
---

A few weeks ago, I updated my analysis on the rising number of million dollar
public homes in Singapore in 2024. Not only did we continue to see a rise in
Singapore million dollar public homes since 2012, these million dollar homes
were continually spreading from the central areas of Singapore to her periphery
regions. Monthly million dollar public home sales were starting to up to 1–2% of
overall public home sales in Singapore, which is a stark rise from the less than
1% a few years ago.

Continuing with this analysis, I wanted to update with the latest data set
(downloaded on 12th March, 2024) and go beyond million dollar public homes to
better understand our overall Singapore public housing market. Maybe our public
homes are still cheap, and these million dollar public homes are just a
minority of outlier public home sales? They only make up at most 2+% of all
public home sales in any given period, right?

##### The Analysis

To refresh our memories, I plotted a box plot distribution of the public home
prices from 2003 to present day. Public home prices were stable from 2003 to
2007, before its (1) steady increase in median prices, (2) increase in the
number of positive outlier home prices and (3) an upwards shift of its price
distribution from 2007 to 2013. Then, the years 2013 to 2019 saw a period of
relative stability, before another spike from 2019 to our present day. The
general trend seems to indicate an overall rise in public home prices in
Singapore.

##### Heat Maps
Next, I plotted a heat map by regions (y-axis), years (x-axis) and regional
median prices (cell) to identify any regional public home trends. The different
accessibility and amenity provisions of different regions should impact their
public home prices.

The heat map (Fig 2) shows that median public home prices rose across all
regions in Singapore since 2003, with Bishan, Bukit Timah and Bukit Merah
reaching median prices of 800K and above in recent years (2024 is incomplete).

{ insert fig 2 }

Next, I do the same heat map using median prices per square feet to account
for size effects, and we see similar price patterns across the regions across
the years. There is an indication that the rise in median home prices is not
due to the recent year sales of bigger size flats.

{ insert fig 3 }

Lastly, I divide the median prices per square feet by their remaining lease to
account for their effects on home prices. Public homes in Singapore have a
99-year lease when purchased from the government, and when the lease is up,
these public homes theoretically have zero value. Hence, the lesser the
remaining lease, in theory, the cheaper these homes should be.

{ insert fig 4 }

In this updated heat map, we now see that Central Area public homes have one of
the higher price ‘scores’ (these data transformations can make their
interpretations confusing). In simpler terms, Central Areas public homes of the
same size and same remaining lease will largely cost more than their counterparts
in other areas. In short, Singaporeans are willing to pay a premium for “central”
(accessible) housing.

##### The Central Million Dollar Question

From my million dollar analysis I found out that the Central Area has one of 
the most number of million dollar public homes. Yet, this current analysis 
shows that the Central Area doesn’t have a high median public home price (Fig 
2 & 3). To investigate this further, I plotted the box plot distributions
between the Central Area and Bishan (an area with high median public home
prices).

{ insert fig 5 }

**This is where I found that the Central Area has had two distinct public home
price groups in recent years with no outlier public home prices, whereas the
Bishan area has a consistent spread of public home sale prices.** This group of
million dollar public homes and lower priced public homes caused the Central 
Area median home prices to be lower than the Bishan median prices. This could
be due the presence of older public housing programmes with the newer programmes
within the Central Area that is causing these two price clusters to form. **In 
other words, our Central Area is not just all about expensive public homes after
all!** The existence of bimodal distributions (histograms with two distinct peaks)
also reflects the trickiness of using a single metric to identify or represent
a region or country’s housing market trend.

##### Public Home Price Groups

Moving away from median and outlier (million dollar) prices, I wanted to 
understand the proportion of public home prices by specific price groups 
instead. I am looking at just home prices, and not price per square feet or 
price per square feet of the remaining lease, because this would most directly
show the financial burden of owning a public home in Singapore. I grouped the
prices into the following: (1) <=300K (2) 300–500K, (3) 500–800K, (4) 800K-1m
and (5) >1m.

I then plot a bar chart stacking the public home sales by their price groups
across the years. From this bar chart, we can see the decline in public homes
sold that are < SGD 300K, and a small rise in those between SGD 500K to a
million dollars.

{ insert fig 6 }

To study these changes more clearly, I plotted these price groups as a 
percentage of total quarterly public home sales (Fig 7). I found that **in 2006,
slightly more than 80% of public homes sold were < SGD 300K, and none sold
were > SGD 500K ! Contrast this to 2023, where public home sales of < SGD 300K
make up less than 2%, and more than 60% of public homes sold are > SGD 500K.**

{ insert fig 7 }

So, if you want to buy a public home in Singapore in 2024 from the resale 
market, there is a low chance you can get it at < SGD 300K. You still have a 
chance of getting a public home in Singapore ranging from SGD 300–500K if you 
are not picky, but looking at SGD 500–800K public home prices will give you 
better odds of securing a public home in Singapore. **The relatively good news 
is that public homes at > SGD 800K are still only 10% of total public homes 
sold in Singapore, even though this number has slowly been increasing in recent
few years, while overall public home sales have remained relatively constant.**
While this data set spans across 17 years, so it is natural to see inflation
affecting our public home prices, it is still interesting to see the extent of
this price shift.

##### Housing Price Groups by Housing Type

Lastly, I want to do a quick look at the same stacked bar chart across different
flat types: (1) 5-Rooms, ECs and Multi-Gen flats together, (2) 4-Room flats,
(3) 3-Room flats and (4) 2-Room flats.

{ insert fig 8 }

( Fig 8 ) Classifying 5-Room, ECs and Multi-Gen flats together, slightly more
than 50% of them were sold at < SGD 300K in the early 2000s. Now, about 70% of 
them are > SGD 500K, and slightly more than 20% of them were sold at > SGD 800K.

{ insert fig 9 }

( Fig 9 ) For 4-room public homes, more than 90% of them used to be sold at
< SGD 300K in the early 2000s. By 2023, more than 60% of them are selling between
SGD 500K to 800K. In fact, you cannot find any 4-room public homes that are
sold at < SGD 300K from 2022.

{ insert fig 10 }

( Fig 10 ) For 3-room public homes, more than 99% of them used to be sold at
< SGD 300K in the early 2000s. Now, more than 85% of them are selling between 
SGD 300K to 500K.

{ insert fig 11 }

( Fig 11 ) For 2-room public homes, more than 90% of them used to be sold at
< SGD 300K in the early 2000s. However, since the early 2020s, this proportion
has been shifting massively, to the point that in 2023, more than 70% of 2-room
public homes are selling between SGD 300K to 500K.

##### Concluding thoughts
Even in 2024, there are public homes that cost < SGD 300K, even though they are
only now just 2-Room and 3-Room flats. 4-Room flats can still cost between SGD
300–500K, even though a larger proportion are between SGD 500–800K. Lastly,
for the larger 5-Room, EC and Multi-Gen flats, only less than 1% of them can
cost < SGD 500K.

Adding on from the rise in million dollar public homes in Singapore, this 
analysis shows that more proportions of Singapore public homes are becoming
expensive nowadays as compared to around two decades ago. There are still 
pockets of cheaper public homes, but they are more rare nowadays.

There are many factors that affect general public housing prices, from new
infrastructure projects, population growth, growth in median household incomes,
changing interest rates and housing supply crunch. All these factors contribute 
to the overall demand and supply of public homes in Singapore, which in turn affect
the overall prices of our public housing market.

While the data does show an increase in overall public home prices, I am not 
saying whether these are good or bad changes. Public homes downgraders should
be happy that they can cash out their public home to boost their retirement 
funds. Some may argue these price shifts indicate that our strong economy and
high quality public homes are continually fuelling their demand and boosting 
public housing prices. Naturally, public home-buyers may look at this analysis
and justify their displeasure on the red-hot Singapore public housing market
of recent years. However, true public housing affordability studies also need
to be aligned with general household incomes, and this is something beyond the
scope of this analysis.

This said, since 2023, the Singapore government has worked on a series of
policy interventions and public home launches to cool down our public housing
market. I will follow this development and update my analysis accordingly.

All in all, I hope my analysis has provided some simple but data-driven view of
our Singapore public housing market. A huge caveat for this analysis is that my
analysis and interpretations are very much an art rather than science.
Nonetheless, I still hope that everyone who has read till here was able to take
away something from this article.
