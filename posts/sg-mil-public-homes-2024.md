title: Singapore Million Dollar Public Homes - 2024 Analysis Update
description: I studied 20 years of Singapore public housing resale data, and found these interesting insights!
---

In Oct 2022, I analysed 20 years of Singapore public housing data, and found an 
increasing trend of million dollar public homes sold from 2012 to 2022. And these
million dollar public home sales were slowly occurring beyond the central residential
areas of Singapore to certain outskirt residential areas. Metaphorically, I described
this situation like a virus spreading from the city centre to the outskirts. While
there have been several government property cooling measures (here and here) since
then, the Singapore public housing market seems to still be red hot, with many new
million dollar public home transactions happening even in 2024. Hence, I want to
update my analysis to see how the situation is now.

##### Update on million dollar homes

I updated my chart to show the number of million dollar public home transactions
per month, and included timestamps of some events.

The three property cooling measures taken by the Singapore government in Sep
2022, Feb 2023 and Apr 2023 did lead to some drop in million dollar transactions
in the following month. **However, the measures did not stop the upward trend of
million dollar transactions, with it reaching its historical peak of 70 in Jan
2024.**

##### Percentage of million dollar public homes
I also updated the view on per month million dollar transactions as a percentage
of overall public housing transactions This is because the increase in million
dollar transactions could be from a proportionate increase in overall public
housing transactions. In Figure 2, the bar chart shows the number of monthly
public home transactions, while the line chart shows the percentage of public
home transactions that were worth a million Singapore dollars or more.

**We see the general increase in percentage of million dollar public home
transactions over total public home transactions starting from Dec 2019.
In fact, each month since Dec 2021 had roughly at least 1% or more (only April
2023 had 0.97%) of public home transactions that were million dollar homes!**
This percentage also hit its historical high in Jan 2024, at 2.95%. During
pre-covid times, million dollar public home transactions were barely above 0.5%
of overall public home transactions.

##### Spread of million dollar public homes
Next, we look at the distribution of million dollar public transactions in Figure 3.

We see that all regions with million dollar transactions in 2022 had even more
million dollar transactions in 2023 ( ***except Bishan*** ). Bukit Panjang also
had their first million dollar transaction in 2023. The **“million dollar home
virus”** has continued its spread in 2023.

##### Heat Maps — Spread of million dollar public homes
I also added several heat maps to show the spread of these million dollar public
homes across the years. Brighter and redder areas have more million dollar public
home transactions. To keep things succinct, I am only showing heat maps from
2015, 2021, 2022 and 2023.

In 2015, we only saw million dollar public homes in the south of Singapore.

By 2021, we see more million dollar homes beyond the south, and into the central
and west parts of Singapore.

{ insert Fig 6 }

In 2022, million dollar homes continue to spread further into the suburbs,
to certain north and east regions of Singapore.

Lastly in 2023, we see even more million dollar homes in both the central,
west and east areas (the spots get redder or bigger). Visually, the heat maps
paint a very stark picture on the spread of million dollar public homes across
Singapore in the past few years.

##### Some ideas
Despite several government property cooling measures, we continue to see a
rising number of million dollar public home transactions across different
parts of Singapore. 

That said, I am not concluding that the Singapore property market is now
*unaffordable*. Calculating housing affordability requires more work than I
can commit to. Nonetheless, just like how our media likes to continually report
on million dollar public home transactions, I feel million dollar public homes
create a psychologically intimidating anchor for many Singaporeans.

This said, many factors could suggest why million dollar public homes are
becoming so common:

1. The demand for public housing in Singapore remains high, from young families
buying their first homes to families downgrading from private homes.

2. There was a public housing supply crunch in Singapore that started during
the Covid-19 period, and the public housing supply is only starting to ramp up.

3. The quality of Singapore public housing remains high, and families are
willing to upwards of a million Singapore dollars for some of them due to
their good location and their previous owners keeping the homes in good condition.

4. The booming Singapore private housing market is causing previous potential
upgraders to stay on or look at public housing instead.

5. Home sellers tend to anchor their expected sale prices to recent neighbouring
public home transactions, and there were similar public homes around their
region that were sold for a million dollars, these home sellers will be less
willing to accept a lower offer.

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, although the numbers suggest that million dollar public homes 
are becoming more common in Singapore, even at its peak, only 2.95% of public
homes transacted in a month are a million dollars or more. While there many
fascination about million dollar public homes, from the windfall for home
sellers to exorbitantly high price for home buyers, I am interested to see
how this trend continues, and to see if the Singapore government will implement
more measures to tackle this situation.
